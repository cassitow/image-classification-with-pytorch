<img width="780" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bed739a0-e35b-447d-9b2d-cbc56392b66c">

This project focuses on image classification using deep learning techniques, particularly leveraging data augmentation to improve model performance. The model is built using PyTorch and trained on a dataset of images, with various augmentations applied to enhance generalization and robustness.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: The model classifies images into predefined categories using the dataset STL-10.
- **Data Augmentation**: A variety of data augmentation techniques (like random cropping, flipping, etc.) are used to increase the diversity of the training set and reduce overfitting.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A simple CNN model is used for image classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: The project includes functionality to evaluate model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Exploration of different learning rates and batch sizes to optimize model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **PyTorch**: A deep learning framework used for building and training the neural network.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for array manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used for visualizing training progress, image augmentations, and evaluation results.
- **Seaborn**: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib, used for creating heatmaps of confusion matrices.
- **scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning that includes utilities for evaluation metrics like classification report and confusion matrix.
- **torchvision**: A package that provides tools for image processing and data augmentation.
