# Image Classification with Augmentation using PyTorch

This project focuses on image classification using deep learning techniques, particularly leveraging data augmentation to improve model performance. The model is built using PyTorch and trained on a dataset of images, with various augmentations applied to enhance generalization and robustness.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: The model classifies images into predefined categories.
- **Data Augmentation**: A variety of data augmentation techniques (like random cropping, flipping, etc.) are used to increase the diversity of the training set and reduce overfitting.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A simple CNN model is used for image classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: The project includes functionality to evaluate model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Exploration of different learning rates and batch sizes to optimize model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **PyTorch**: A deep learning framework used for building and training the neural network.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for array manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used for visualizing training progress, image augmentations, and evaluation results.
- **Seaborn**: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib, used for creating heatmaps of confusion matrices.
- **scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning that includes utilities for evaluation metrics like classification report and confusion matrix.
- **torchvision**: A package that provides tools for image processing and data augmentation.
